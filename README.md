# prometheus-operator-app chart

Giant Swarm offers a Prometheus Operator Managed App which can be installed in
tenant clusters. Here we define the Prometheus chart with its templates and
default configuration.

The Custom Resource Definitions are taken from [the official repo](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator).
